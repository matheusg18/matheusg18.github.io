      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Full-Stack Engineer who discovered my passion for coding while learning C language in university. That
        initial curiosity grew into a career where I now build AI-powered solutions, scalable microservices, and
        cloud-native applications using modern technologies like Vue.js, Next.js, Node.js, and Python.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm an avid gamer and anime enthusiast who believes great storytelling - whether in code or
        entertainment - can create meaningful experiences. My approach to technology mirrors how I approach life: always
        learning, always creating. From professional projects at UOL Ads to personal experiments like game development,
        I love turning ideas into reality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What motivates me most is the creative process of building solutions that make an impact. While I take my work
        seriously, I never lose the sense of wonder that first drew me to programming. It's this balance between
        professional dedication and personal passion that drives me forward - both in writing clean code and in enjoying
        life's adventures with my family.

As part of a talented development team, I use agile methodologies such as Scrum to develop the frontend primarily using Vue.js, JavaScript, and SASS, and the backend using microservices with the Spring Framework and Node.js.
Additionally, I focus on innovation using Artificial Intelligence to enhance and evolve product solutions.
My goal is to contribute to the continuous evolution of UOL Ads in a scalable and self-testing manner, always applying best development practices to ensure that the product remains a reliable and high-quality solution.`,

        description: `In the Asa Branca extension project at UFPE, I worked as a programmer on the control team. My main responsibility was to develop the tracking feature for the CubeSat using the C++ programming language. Additionally, I was also responsible for reporting progress on a weekly basis in meetings with the team.

During my time on the project, I learned to work effectively in a team and honed my programming and problem-solving skills. This experience provided me with valuable technical and interpersonal skills that continue to be relevant in my current career as a fullstack software engineer.`,
